# virtual-mouse
The limitations of a wired mouse—its short range and the difficulty of handling in spaces that lack room — led to the invention of wireless mouse, which have become increasingly popular over time because you can customize them to fit your computing habits.

The usage of a wireless mouse has been a boon to the computer user. The freedom of movement it provides is unrivaled and has made the personalization of computer usage a reality. With this advancement in technology, there has been a trend towards natural human interaction with computers by incorporating hand gestures as a means to navigate through various applications.
